________________________________

There are both python3 and C++ code available. The C++ code has more features and sanity checks but the opencv version is obsolete. I recommend starting with python version. Since the steps are same as c++, the documentation of c++ still applies to the python version with some minor changes.

<b>Python3:</b>
- opencv verion 4.4.0 (No cuda needed)

```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
  python main.py
``` 
This code reads from a video and outputs an image, i.e.`mosaic.jpg`

Note that the input file is `Data\rotate.mjpeg`, which is in a format that VLC doesn't normally play.  To convert to mp4, try this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i Data\rotate.mjpeg -vf "scale=500:374" -c:v libx264 output_file.mp4
```

<b>C++:</b>
- opencv 2.4 with cuda support

C++ verison can work with live camera/webcam or a recorded video. You can read the manual to know how to feed a video stream to it or use a live camera. For live camera, it may not be robust. The output is related to quality of the camera and not having blured frames when moving.

To run in your own machine:
You need to compile CUDA for your opencv 2.411 version and then recompile the code in your machine.
There is a manual I wrote: "how to compile the code.pdf" or you can use other helpful links over the internet about compiling opencv for cuda.
I used visual studio but you can use g++ to compile but you need to link the libraries.
